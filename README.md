# Squirrel-Census-Data-Analysis
This Python script analyzes the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data to count the number of squirrels based on their fur color and saves the results in a CSV file.

# Project Overview
The script performs the following tasks:

Reads the squirrel census data from a CSV file.
Counts the number of squirrels with different fur colors: Gray, Cinnamon (Red), and Black.
Creates a new DataFrame with the fur color and the corresponding counts.
Saves the resulting data into a new CSV file called squirrel_count.csv.
# Output
The script generates a CSV file named squirrel_count.csv with the following structure:

| Fur Color | Count |
| --------- | ----- |
| GRAY      | ...   |
| CINNAMON  | ...   |
| BLACK     | ...   |
